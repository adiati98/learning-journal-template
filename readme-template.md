# Learning Journal

This repo is where I'm keeping track of my accessibility learning journey.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

I aim to learn more about accessibility to build accessible apps for users.

What I want to accomplish in the next 30 days:

- Learn about Semantic HTML.
- Learn about ARIA.
- Learn how to use accessibility evaluation tools such as [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) and screen readers.
- Write articles about what I learned.
- Give a Luch and Learn or lightning talk at Virtual Coffee.

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress Track
